# Froob "Bot"
### Not really a bot, but this is the 21st century, so we're gonna roll with it.

Includes a fully-functional command line menu with basic error handling (buggy). Additionally includes a text-based adventure game that is still a WIP. The code isn't written well, nor is it efficient, but as always, feel free to use it for personal use!
